**Unit 9: The Cardiovascular System** <span id="9"></span> 
*The heart and the circulatory system use blood to deliver oxygen and
nutrients to the body cells and to remove carbon dioxide and wastes. The
heart acts as a pump contracting hard to squeeze blood to the lungs or
to the body cells and does this 24 hours a day 7 days a week. If you
have ever felt your heart beating, you have felt the power of this
organ. If the heart started to fail, blood would not get to all of the
body cells as readily and the cells might die. Waste would increase,
because blood might not make it to the kidney to be filtered, and carbon
dioxide would build up, because there would be less passes through the
lungs. Clearly, the pumping action of the heart is important! In this
unit, we will study the processes behind a properly functioning
circulatory system and the important interactions with other systems
such as the renal and respiratory systems.*

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   identify the different parts of the circulatory system, including
    the heart, blood vessels, and blood;
-   describe the structure and function of the heart and the cardiac
    cycle, including systolic and diastolic cycles;
-   describe the electrical activity of the heart, cardiac muscle
    contraction, and ECG;
-   identify blood vessels and describe the structure and function of
    arteries, veins, and capillaries; and
-   identify the composition of the blood; describe the composition and
    function of the plasma; and identify blood cells and their
    functions.
