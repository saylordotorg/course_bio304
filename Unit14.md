**Unit 14: The Reproductive System** <span id="14"></span> 
*The reproductive system controls the production of sex hormones, gender
determination, and most importantly reproduction. There are distinct
differences between males and females, including those that are obvious.
Hormonal production is a key feature of the reproductive system, and
additionally, hormones regulate the function of this system in an
intricate balance. You may recall some of these hormones from our
endocrine system unit. In this unit, we will learn about the female and
male reproductive systems function alone and in conjunction with one
another to produce life. In this capacity, we will discuss the processes
of fertilization, pregnancy, and labor.*

    System”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BIO304-14.1-BriefOverviewofMaleandFemaleReproductiveSystem.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, which provides an overview of
    human sexual reproduction, and both male and female reproductive
    systems.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 45 minutes.

**14.2 Male Reproductive System** <span id="14.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: “The Male Reproductive
    System”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: [“The Male Reproductive
    System”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/The_male_reproductive_system) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage to
    learn more about the structure, function, and physiology of the male
    reproductive system including puberty and aging. Notice how a male’s
    hormones play a big role in development. Like all endocrine systems,
    the gonads are regulated through feedback mechanisms.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 2 hours.

    System”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/The_female_reproductive_system) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage to
    learn more about the structure, function, and physiology of the
    female reproductive system, including the external and internal
    genitals. Estrogen plays an important role in female functioning,
    including bone health, metabolism, and of course reproductive
    function.
