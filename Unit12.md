**Unit 12: The Digestive System** <span id="12"></span> 
*The digestive system begins in the mouth and continues through the
stomach and intestines, ending at the anus. In the mouth, chemical and
mechanical digestion begins. Food moves down the esophagus and into the
stomach for further digestion. Next, in the small intestines final
chemical breakdown and absorption occurs. What is left over after
absorption moves into the large intestines, where mainly only water is
absorbed. This waste material is further broken down by bacteria in the
large intestines and finally leaves the body through the anus via a
bowel movement. We control when we eat, but once we swallow our food,
the process until fecal matter leaves the anus is involuntary. This unit
discusses the steps of the digestive system from ingestion through
elimination.*

**Unit12 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   describe the structure and function of the organs of the digestive
    system;
-   describe the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination and
    their associated organs; and
-   identify the disorders within the digestive system.
