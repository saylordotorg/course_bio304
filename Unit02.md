**Unit 2: Chemical Composition of the Body and Cell Structure** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will cover the basic concepts of chemistry, which are
required to understand the molecular make-up of the body. Small chemical
elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, among others form larger
molecules including carbohydrates, lipids (fats), proteins, and nucleic
acids. These macromolecules form the cells that make up tissues and
carry out many other important structural and functional roles. You will
find lipids and proteins forming the membrane surrounding cells.
Proteins and lipids are also hormones, such as the thyroid hormones (T3
and T4) and the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. Our genetic DNA
is made up of nucleic acids, as is energy ATP. Without carbohydrates, we
would not be able to feed our cells glucose or store it for times when
we cannot eat. The importance of these chemical compounds cannot be
stressed enough. Once you have a good grasp of this information, review
cell physiology. Cells are tiny units of life that work with other cells
to keep the body in homeostasis. More information about molecules and
cells can also be found in [BIO101A or BIO101B: Introduction to
Molecular and Cellular Biology](http://www.saylor.org/majors/biology/).*

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   describe the structure of an atom, and define chemical bonds;

    Cell”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmwvj9X4GNY) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this excellent
    video for an overview of the eukaryotic cell structure and the
    function of each organelle. The lecturer does a great job describing
    the structure of the cell from the outside to the inside in a very
    simple, easy to understand manner. Notice how each organelle in the
    cell has an important, specific job. Take notes or even try to draw
    your own cell as you watch the video. You may remember some of this
    information from [BIO 101A or BIO101B: Introduction to Molecular and
    Cellular Biology](http://www.saylor.org/majors/biology/).  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

    Physiology”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/Cell_physiology)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this chapter to learn about cells and how these
    tiny compartments work. Each cell functions on its own and in
    conjunction with other cells to carry out its job.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 2 hours.

    Model”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqsf_UJcfBc&feature=related)
    (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this brief video
    for a summary of the properties of the cell membrane. Notice that
    the membrane is made lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates creating a
    mosaic structure that continuously moves (is fluid). This is the
    basic idea of the fluid mosaic model, which is often used to
    describe the cell membrane.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    Exercises”](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072351136/student_view0/chapter3/labeling_exercises.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: These labeling exercises review some of the important
    topics that we have discussed thus far about the cell. Although the
    exercises are sometimes confusing regarding exactly what is being
    identified, it is not graded and allows you to test your
    understanding of cell structure. Complete all six exercises and
    repeat until you have mastered them.  
      
     Completing these assessments should take approximately 2 hours.

    Synthesis”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJxobgkPEAo) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this brief YouTube
    video for a summary of protein synthesis and the role of the
    ribosome. Making proteins is important for cell structure and
    function. If the cell could not make proteins, we would have no
    keratin to provide structure to our skin and nails, no amylase or
    lipase for carbohydrate and lipid digestion in the gastrointestinal
    track, and no hemoglobin to hold oxygen on the red blood cells.
    Without proteins, our cells would die and our body as a whole would
    not survive.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
