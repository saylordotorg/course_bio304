**Unit 1: Introduction to Physiology** <span id="1"></span> 
*The study of physiology requires you to grasp a few basic concepts.
This brief unit will review concepts including the overall organization
of the body and the definition of homeostasis. You may recall from
anatomy that small chemicals come together to form cells, which combine
to form four tissue types. These tissues create all of the systems found
in the body including the cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory
systems, among others. These systems work together to ensure that the
body is at its optimal, balanced state, known as homeostasis. When
homeostasis is compromised, disease ensues. This is most often when
patients visit their healthcare professional, although regular well
exams are also important in catching disease states that might not be as
obvious.  
  
 Our understanding of medicine stems from research. In order to study
physiology and diseases (pathophysiology), researchers use the
scientific method. This guideline allows researchers to study science in
a controlled way that eliminates bias. For example, if you were
comparing laundry detergents, it would be unfair to use your dirtiest
load for one brand and a less dirty load for the other brand. You would
need to wash both loads with an even distribution of laundry (types of
items and level of dirtiness) at exactly the same wash settings. The
only thing that would change (or the variable) would be the detergent.
Only then could you make an accurate comparison. The same is true for
scientific research. You would not want to take medicine or use a
product that was not appropriately researched. Of course, there are
other aspects to this scientific method. As you work through the
scientific method section, think about how our laundry detergent example
fits into this process.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this entire video.
    This video does a fantastic job of reviewing several terms and
    concepts that are important in anatomy and physiology, including
    homeostasis and the hierarchy of the body from small chemical
    molecules all the way up to the complete human body. You learned
    about tissues in anatomy, and this video will remind you of this
    information, focusing on the important features of all four tissue
    types. The video ends with a brief description of organ systems,
    which will be the focus of this course. The more you know about
    anatomy, the easier it will be to understand the structure-function
    relationship that is key to studying physiology.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Introduction to Anatomy”**

    Introduction to
    Anatomy”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Biology-Corners-Anantomy-and-Physiology-Ch.-1.pdf) (PDF)   
        
     Instructions: Read the notes linked above to get an overall
    description of how tissues make up organs and how organs work
    together to make up organ systems. Use the “Body Systems Concept
    Map” to test your knowledge of the structure and function of
    different organ systems.  
        
     Reading these notes and exploring the concept map should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

**1.2 Homeostasis and Feedback Systems** <span id="1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: “Homeostasis Overview”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: [“Homeostasis
    Overview”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/Homeostasis)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read the “Homeostasis
    Overview” section to gain an understanding of homeostasis and its
    importance to overall body function. When homeostasis is lost,
    disease ensues. For example, if you cut your skin, this is a very
    simple example of how the loss of homeostasis could occur. The skin
    is not able to maintain its protective barrier or carry out its
    other functions; therefore, the normal activity in this area is not
    in homeostasis. Another example is if your intake of iron decreases.
    If your iron stores deplete, your production of red blood cells may
    go down leading to a condition known as iron deficiency anemia. Your
    body cells will get less oxygen and as a result your body will
    reduce the amount of activity that you are able to do and you may
    feel tired. In this example, the body as a whole is not functioning
    at its optimal state; therefore, the body is not in homeostasis.
    This reading will help you to better understand this concept.
    Consider these examples as you learn more about homeostasis.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this brief video to
    review homeostasis. Although the liver is listed with the renal
    system in this video, it is important to note that the liver is not
    a part of the renal system. The liver simply works with the renal
    system to maintain homeostasis.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
