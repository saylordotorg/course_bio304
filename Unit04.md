**Unit 4: Movement of Materials and Cell Signaling** <span
id="4"></span> 
*This unit will discuss the fluid compartments in the body and the
movement of materials between them. The movement of particles from an
area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration is known
as diffusion. Sodium, for example, is found in high concentrations
outside the cell and lower concentrations inside the cell. If a special
channel in the cell membrane opens, sodium can diffuse across the
membrane from the area of higher concentration (outside) to the area of
lower concentration (inside). The diffusion of water is called osmosis.
It is important to have a good understanding of how diffusion and
osmosis work, because cell physiology depends on these activities. We
will also review the resting membrane potential of the cell as well as
cell communication through various signaling pathways. You will see
sodium again as an important player in these processes. These are
difficult concepts, so review the material as many times as necessary in
order to get a good grasp of the material.*

     Instructions: Watch the lecture for an introduction to diffusion
    and osmosis. You may recall from your earlier courses that diffusion
    is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to
    an area of lower concentration. Osmosis is simply the diffusion of
    water. This video does a great job covering these sometimes
    difficult concepts.

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the section titled
    “Body Fluids” to learn about extracellular and intracellular
    environments. By understanding how the body is compartmentalized, we
    begin to see how homeostasis is maintained and a loss of homeostasis
    is controlled.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch this brief video for a quick summary of passive
    transport mechanisms. This video discusses two types of diffusion –
    simple and facilitated diffusion – as well as osmosis, the diffusion
    of water. The diffusion types discussed here are passive, meaning
    that energy is not required.

     Instructions: Watch this video on the action of the
    sodium-potassium pump, a common example of active transport through
    a cell membrane. As the video mentions, active transport requires
    ATP energy to run this pump. Without ATP, the pump will not run and
    sodium and potassium will not move across the membrane against their
    concentration gradient (from low concentration to high
    concentration).  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take

     Instructions: Click on the links above, and read the sections
    “Neurons” and “Neurophysiology” through the subsection “Resting
    Potential” to learn about the membrane potential and the role of the
    K<sup>+</sup> (potassium) and Na<sup>+</sup> (sodium) equilibrium
    potentials. These concepts may seem difficult, because they are so
    abstract. However, it is necessary to have a good grasp of this
    material in order to conceptualize how neuron signaling to other
    neurons, muscles, and glands is carried out. When studying this,
    keep in mind that particles move from areas of higher concentration
    to areas of lower concentration (diffusion) and that at rest, sodium
    is higher outside the cell and potassium is higher inside the cell.
    Also, there are more negative proteins and chloride inside the cell
    than outside, making the inside negative relative to the outside.
    The cell must have this configuration at rest (resting membrane
    potential) in order for signaling to occur. This is called an
    electrochemical gradient. You may want to review the material
    several times.  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 45 minutes.
