**Unit 10: The Respiratory System** <span id="10"></span> 
*The respiratory system depends on the heart to pump blood to the lungs.
In capillaries found in the lungs, carbon dioxide detaches from the
hemoglobin in red blood cells and enters the air sacs known as alveoli.
With exhalation, carbon dioxide is breathed out. With inhalation, oxygen
is breathed into the alveoli. It moves out of the air sacs into the
capillaries and attaches to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. The cells
then carry oxygen back to the heart and out to the body’s cells. The gas
exchange occurs each time we breathe. When we hold our breath, oxygen
cannot get into the lungs and carbon dioxide cannot leave. The body
cells may become oxygen deprived and carbon dioxide builds up. You know
what happens next, we take a breath!*

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   describe the structure and function of the organs of the respiratory
    system;
-   describe the mechanisms of breathing, including the muscles involved
    in inspiration and exhalation;
-   describe the mechanisms of gas exchange and gas transport (oxygen
    and carbon dioxide); and
-   identify and describe major diseases of the respiratory system.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage to
    understand how the body takes in oxygen and gets rids of carbon
    dioxide. You may recall that the red blood cells are involved in the
    process of delivering oxygen to the body cells and bringing carbon
    dioxide back to the lungs to be exhaled. All the systems work
    together!
