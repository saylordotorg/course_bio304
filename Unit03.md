**Unit 3: Enzymes, Cellular Respiration, and Cellular Metabolism** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Protein enzymes play a significant role in catalyzing (speeding up the
rate of) chemical reactions in our body. Protein enzymes are important
facilitators in all cellular metabolic processes from digestion to
respiration to growth. Enzymes require strict environmental conditions,
including pH and temperature requirements and become non-functional or
even destroyed if these needs are not met. It is interesting to note
that although enzymes bring substances (substrates) together to have a
reaction, the enzymes themselves are not changed in this reaction. It is
imperative that you understand how enzymes work, because we will see
them in all body systems that we cover in this course.*

**3.1 Enzymes** <span id="3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*: “Enzymes –
    Overview”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*: [“Enzymes –
    Overview”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme#Overview) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above, read the introductory text,
    and click on the table of contents to access and read the “Lock and
    Key Model” and “Induced Fit” sections for an introduction to enzymes
    and enzymatic action. All cells in the body use enzymes to speed up
    the rate of reactions. As you can imagine, we cannot live without
    them!  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 30 minutes.

-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*: “Active Site”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*: [“Active
    Site”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active_Site) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the “Overview” and
    “Enzyme Inhibitors” sections to learn how enzymatic reactions can be
    inhibited. It is as important that actions in the body can be
    stopped as it is that they can start in the first place. Otherwise,
    control might be lost, and then homeostasis might be lost. This
    reading will show you how enzyme activity is controlled.  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 1 hour.

    Feedback”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRWqBld7XU) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this brief YouTube
    video about enzyme feedback inhibition through a negative feedback
    loop. Remember that homeostasis is regulated, in part, by positive
    and negative feedback loops. As you might imagine, enzyme activity
    is important for regulating and maintaining homeostasis.

Transport Chain** <span id="3.2"></span>

    Respiration”**

    Respiration”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f7YwCtHcgk)
    (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this video to learn
    about cellular respiration, which is the process by which the cell
    extracts energy from glucose. This is a very complex process, but
    the lecturer does a good job of breaking it down into manageable
    segments. Cells within the body use this process to convert
    carbohydrate glucose into usable nucleic acid ATP energy. Cellular
    Respiration is also described in greater detail in [BIO101A:
    Introduction to Molecular and Cellular
    Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/) in “Unit 6:
    Cellular Energy.”  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Complete the above quiz and then click the “Submit
    Answers” button at the bottom of the page for instant grading and
    feedback. Some of these questions require you to recall what you
    learned in BIO101A. For any questions that you get incorrect, go
    back and review the material in the “Unit 6: Cellular Respiration”
    of BIO101A.  
      
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour.

-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*: “Metabolism”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Structural Biochemistry*:
    [“Metabolism”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Metabolism) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read the entire webpage,
    which will provide you with an overview of the metabolic processes
    of an organism. Metabolism includes anabolism (putting things
    together) and catabolism (breaking things apart). Catabolism often
    provides energy to drive other activities in the body, whereas
    anabolism often requires energy. Without metabolism, cells in the
    body would not have energy and would eventually die.
