**Unit 6: The Sensory System** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit reviews the mechanics behind sensory reception and our
interpretation of sensory input. In this unit, you will learn how our
sensory organs receive external stimuli, such as noise, images, food,
etc., and how the brain processes and translates them so that they are
perceived.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 7 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.4: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.5: 2.5 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   identify the touch receptors;
-   describe the modalities of taste;
-   describe the modalities of smell and the olfactory pathway; and
-   describe the structure of the ear and the role of the inner, middle,
    and outer ear in hearing and equilibrium.

**6.1 General Properties of Special Senses** <span id="6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: “Senses”**

    [“Senses”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/Senses) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this entire webpage
    to understand how our special senses are more directly linked to the
    central nervous system. Attempt the review questions at the end of
    the reading. After completing the questions, click on the link at
    the beginning of the section to review the answers.  
      
     Reading this webpage and answering the review questions should take
    approximately 2 hours.

    Taste”](http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=AP14104)
    (Flash)  
      
     Instructions: This is a simple, interactive overview of the sense
    of taste. Notice how the structure of the taste bud (onion shaped)
    is important for the function of taste. You may want to review the
    12 Cranial Nerves when you are given the option to do so in this
    exercise. At the end, practice what you learned with the labeling
    exercise.  
      
     Studying this material should take approximately 1 hour.

    Smell”](http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=AP14004)
    (Flash)  
      
     Instructions: This short interactive animation shows how chemicals
    around us are detected and converted into the sense of smell. The
    sounds associated with the animation may not be especially
    appealing, so if it bothers you, turn down your volume.  
      
     Studying this animation should take approximately 1 hour.
