**Unit 7: The Muscular System** <span id="7"></span> 
*The muscular system allows the body to move, inside and out. Often we
think of the muscular system as big biceps like Popeye or strong leg
muscles like you might see on Olympic runners. While these skeletal
muscles are important, the muscular system is much more than just
skeletal muscle. The cardiac muscles that make up the myocardium of the
heart keep the heart contracting 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Unlike
skeletal muscle that gets tired and we control (voluntary), cardiac
muscle never fatigues and we have no control over it (involuntary). A
third type of muscle is smooth muscle. It is also involuntary and can be
found lining the gastrointestinal track, around the alveoli in the
lungs, and even in the female uterus, among other places. Smooth muscle
has long rhythmic contractions that are involuntary. Unless they are
super strong – like in childbirth – or they are erratic and cause
stomach cramping, we do not even realize that they are contracting. All
three muscle types work hard to move things – for example blood
(cardiac), food (smooth), and our pencil to take notes (skeletal). In
this unit, we will explore how muscles contract to cause this movement
and learn a bit more how these three muscle types are alike and differ.
Finally, we will make the important connection between the muscular
system and other systems in the body, such as the nervous system.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   identify the different types of muscle tissues;

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this chapter on the
    muscular system. As you read note the key differences between
    skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and consider how each muscle
    type has a particular structure that helps it to carry out its own
    function. This chapter contains a lot of information. It may be
    helpful to make a chart with the three muscle types and their
    characteristics and location.  
      
     Reading this chapter and taking notes should take 2 hours and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this video for a
    brief visual illustration of the structure of skeletal muscles. The
    structure function relationship is very important in skeletal
    muscle. Notice how the cross bridges allow for contraction and when
    relaxed, myosin binding sites are covered to prevent cross bridges
    from forming.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch this video to
    visualize the process of contraction in skeletal muscle tissue.
    Notice the complexity of this process! Can you believe that this
    process is happening in milliseconds?
