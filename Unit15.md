**Unit 15: The Immune System** <span id="15"></span> 
*The immune system fights off infection and disease. It begins with
lines of defense (i.e. your skin) and is backed by the blood and
lymphatic systems. White blood cells patrol the blood and lymphatic
system looking for foreign invaders. Five white blood cell types are
found in the blood, including those that phagocytize (engulf) bacteria
and amoebas. Others release histamine, other granules, or antibodies in
allergic or antigen specific responses. Some of these move out of the
blood into the tissue and specialized immune system cells are also found
in the tissue space. Collectively these cells, along with other factors
and organs such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, protect your body and
help maintain homeostasis. In this unit, we will study the ways that
your immune system works to keep your body safe and in good health.*

**15.1 Immune System: Overview** <span id="15.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: “The Immune System”**

    System”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/The_Immune_System#Overview) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage about
    the immune system, which includes an explanation of the lymphatic
    system and its importance to the body’s overall defense mechanisms.
    This system allows us to live in a world that is filled with
    microorganisms. It also protects us from our own cells that get out
    of control and at times even causes disease.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Click on the links above and watch these videos for a
    visual review of the immune response and the lymphatic system. Take
    note of the organs, tissues, and cells involved and how they work
    together for a common purpose. Did you notice how many different
    cells and factors are involved in the immune response? This video is
    just an overview and does not cover all of the players in this
    process. It is a very complex job protecting the body from harm!  
      
     Watching these videos and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    defense. As you complete this reading, please focus on answering two
    questions: 1) What are the “lines of defense,” or the “players” in
    immune response? 2) What are the steps in the process of immune
    response.  
      
     Reading this webpage and answering the questions above should take
