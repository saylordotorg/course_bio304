**Unit 11: The Urinary System** <span id="11"></span> 
*The Urinary System, also known as the renal or excretory system, plays
a significant role in filtering out the waste that our body produces. As
we learned in the cardiovascular system unit, the heart pumps blood to
the kidneys for filtration. The kidneys remove nitrogenous wastes and
form urine to flush it from the body. The kidneys are also involved in
water balance. Think about the last time that you were dehydrated. What
color was your urine? Dark? This is because the kidneys excreted body
wastes in as little water as possible to try and conserve. On the other
hand, if you are well hydrated, you will likely find that your urine is
light yellow to almost clear. Lesser known functions of the kidney
include stimulation of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells,
regulation of electrolyte balance, and a major role in acid-base
buffering. This unit will focus on these various renal activities.*

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 6 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.1: 3.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.2: 0.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.3: 2.5 hours

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   describe the structure and function of the organs of the urinary
    system;
-   explain the steps of urine formation and identify related organs;
    and
-   describe the role of the kidneys in regulating renal water and salt
    balance.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this webpage about
    the urinary system, which is sometimes also called the renal system.
    The kidneys filter wastes from the blood and form urine. Urine is
    stored in the bladder and a series of tubes drain urine from the
    kidneys to the bladder (ureters) and then from the bladder to
    outside the body (urethra).  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 2 hours.
