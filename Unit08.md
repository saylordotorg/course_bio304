**Unit 8: The Endocrine System** <span id="8"></span> 
*Hormones secreted from our endocrine glands regulate numerous processes
in our bodies. Testosterone, estrogen, and growth hormone, among others
control our development in the womb and following birth into young
adulthood. It is also testosterone and estrogen that regulates
reproductive function. Thyroid hormones control our metabolism and
imbalances may lead to weigh loss or gain, anxiety or depression, sleep
and eating disturbances, and even hair and skin changes. Insulin and
glucagon from the pancreas determines how glucose is regulated and used
by the body cells and keeps us form having blood sugar levels that are
too low or too high. In conjunction with the nervous system, the
endocrine system is instrumental in maintaining homeostasis.*

-   **Reading: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: “The Endocrine System”**
    Link: Wikibooks’ *Human Physiology*: [“The Endocrine
    System”](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/The_endocrine_system) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this entire webpage
    to understand the endocrine system structure and function. This
    reading also provides a description of hormone classification and
    function. This is a very complex system with a lot of different
    factors involved. Additionally, control mechanisms are in place on
    multiple levels. You may find that making a summary chart is
    helpful. The chart should contain the hormone name, abbreviation,
    its source and target, and its action.   
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 2 hours.
