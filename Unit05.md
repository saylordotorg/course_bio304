**Unit 5: The Nervous System** <span id="5"></span> 
*The nervous system allows us to think and act. Typing on your keyboard
happens because of signals between the brain and the neurons and muscles
in your hand. Are you focusing on the difficult concepts in this course
and trying to remember all that you have learned thus far? It is the
nervous system that makes it all possible! Neurons signal from the brain
and spinal cord (central nervous system) to the muscles, glands, and
other neurons found outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral
nervous system). In this unit, we will study how the central and
peripheral nervous system work together to coordinate our complicated
activities and respond to environmental stimuli. You will also learn how
the body reacts during emergencies or what the body perceives as
emergencies in fight-or-flight reactions and the outcome of the
activities involved with the autonomic nervous system, such as
digestion, sleep states, and even reproduction. *

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read this entire webpage
    about the nervous system. This text does a great job covering
    neurons and supporting cells and their activities in the brain and
    spinal cord and throughout the body. The following subunits will
    focus on various aspects of this reading assignment. You may also
    want to refer back to the “Anatomy of a Neuron” video that you
    watched in subunit 4.2.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 3 hours and 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: Now that you have a good understanding about the
    neuron and how it works, let’s take it one step further and delve
    into the physiology of this cell. Watch these three videos to learn
    about how the neuron signals with ionic channels in a signaling
    event known as the action potential. These three videos are in-depth
    tutorials about the physiological processes underlying neuronal
    signaling.  
      
     Watching these videos and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Watch these two videos to learn how action potential
    signals travel from one neuron to the next. This signaling process
    is necessary to signal between neurons and as you will learn later
    and is also found when neurons signal to muscles and glands in an
    excitatory manner.

    poorly understood, imaging studies help scientists to identify the
    differences that are found with these disorders. From this video,

    (YouTube) and [“Flexor
    Reflex”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLe9koPfVoo&feature=related)
    (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the links above, and watch these three brief
    YouTube videos for a visual summary of the spinal cord’s function
    and the reflexes within the nervous system. You will notice in the
    Gene Ed video how neurons enter and exit the spinal cord through the
    dorsal and ventral sections, respectively. Recall your basic
    terminology. Dorsal (like the dorsal fin on a dolphin) is towards
    the back, whereas ventral faces the front. This terminology carries
    over into Dr. Sullivan’s discussion of reflexes and reflex arcs.
    Notice how information is routed from the receptor through the
    sensory neuron to the spinal cord and then back out through the
    motor neuron to the effector. If one synapse is involved, this is
    monosynaptic (mono means one), and if more than one is involved,
    this is polysynaptic (poly means many). If you have difficulty
    remembering these general terms, it may be beneficial to go back to
    the [Unit 1 in BIO 302 Human
    Anatomy](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio302/) and review them. The
    third video gives one example of a common reflex arc – the flexor
    arc – that protects you from pain. You have used this reflex arc if
    you ever put your hand on a hot stove.  
      
     Watching these videos and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

**5.3.2 Peripheral Nervous System** <span id="5.3.2"></span> 
*The peripheral nervous system (PNS) included all of the neurons and
supporting nervous system cells found outside of the central nervous
system (CNS, brain and spinal cord). The PNS is divided into two
divisions: sensory and motor. The sensory division has receptors that
detect changes and send this information to the CNS for processing. The
motor division carries information from the CNS back out to the PNS. The
motor division is further divided into the somatic division, which
signals to voluntary skeletal muscles, and the autonomic division, which
controls involuntary activities such cardiac and smooth muscle
contraction and glandular secretion. The autonomic nervous system is
divided even further into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions.*

**5.3.2.1 Sensory Division of Peripheral Nervous System** <span
id="5.3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system carries
signals from the body’s cells to the central nervous system (CNS) for
processing. Receptors on the neuron dendrites respond to stimuli and
send this information the cell body (soma) using graded potentials. Once
the cell body reaches threshold an action potential is generated and the
signal is carried to the CNS.*

**5.3.2.2 Motor Division of Peripheral Nervous System** <span
id="5.3.2.2"></span> 
*The motor division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) carries
signals from the central nervous system (CNS) back out the body’s cell
in the peripheral nervous system. The PNS is divided into the somatic
division, which signals to voluntary skeletal muscle and the autonomic
division, which signals to involuntary smooth and cardiac muscle and
glands.*

    Link: YouTube: ThePenguinProf’s [“Autonomic Nervous
    System”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhD6CEOcuno) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and watch the YouTube video
    for a look at the peripheral nervous system. The video does a great
    job contrasting the somatic and autonomic divisions of the
    peripheral nervous system. There is also a discussion of the
    differences between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
    system divisions of the autonomic division. Remember the PNS is made
    up of the sensory and motor divisions. The motor division is further
    divided into the somatic and autonomic divisions. The autonomic
    division is even further divided into the sympathetic and
    parasympathetic divisions. Make sense? Make sure that you have a
    good grasp of this material and make a chart, if necessary.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
