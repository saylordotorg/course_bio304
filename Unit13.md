**Unit 13: Metabolism** <span id="13"></span> 
*All systems contribute to an organism’s metabolism. The digestive
system absorbs nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids that
can be used by body cells for energy. The endocrine system is involved
in the uptake, storage, and use of these molecules. The heart pumps
blood containing oxygen, which is needed by the body cells to carry out
metabolic processes. Other systems in the body have roles in this
process as well. In this unit, we will integrate our new understanding
of each system to understand how they all work together to affect our
metabolism and contribute to maintaining homeostasis.*

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 2.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.2: 1.5 hours

**Unit13 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   describe the metabolic pathways, including anabolism and catabolism;
-   explain the role of insulin and glucagon in regulating the glucose
    level; and
-   describe the different types of diabetes mellitus.

     Instructions: Read the section titled “Cell Metabolism.” Remember
    what you learned earlier about cellular respiration and use this
    reading as a review of the metabolic processes in the cell.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above and read the section titled
    “Diabetes Mellitus,” including “Control of Insulin Secretion” to
    learn about the different types of diabetes mellitus. Type II
    diabetes mellitus is on the rise because of obesity and decreased
    exercise. Notice the key differences between its cause and that of
    Type I diabetes mellitus.  
      
     Reading this section should take less than 15 minutes.
